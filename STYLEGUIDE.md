# Style Guide

This is the official stork style guide for golang code. This is in addition to the official style guide at https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments.

This is just a rough outline for now, we will formalize this as we go.

### Items

* Use [dlog](https://go.pedge.io/dlog) for logging.

* File order:

```go
package pkg

const (
  ...
)

var (
  ...
)

// but init should generally be not used
func init() {
}

// public struct

// public struct functions

// private struct functions

// private functions but only if they just apply to this struct, otherwise in a common file
```

* All new code must pass `go vet`, `errcheck`, `golint`. For `errcheck`, this means no more unchecked errors. Use of `_ = someFnThatReturnsError()` will be audited soon, and in general should not be used anymore. `golint` means all public types need comments to pass, which means both (A) we will have better code documentation and (B) we will think more about what should actually be public. `errcheck` and `golint` are great deterrents.

* All packages have a file named `name_of_package.go`, ie in `api/server`, we have `server.go`.

* Packages are named after their directory, ie `api/` is `package api`.

* **ALL PUBLIC TYPES GO IN `name_of_package.go`.** Every other file is just a helper file that implements the types.

* Variable names should reflect the type, ie an instance of  `Runner` should be `runner`. This is in contrast to golang's official recommendation, but has been found to make code more readable. Heh. So this means `api.Volume` is not `v, vol, whatever`, it's `volume`, a `request` is not `req, createReq, r`, it's `request`. Only exception is the receiver argument on a function, ie `func (s *server) Foo(...) { ... }`.

* Structs without a corresponding interface are data holders. Structs with functions attached have a public interface wrapper, and then the struct becomes private. Example:

```go
// foo.go
package foo

type Runner interace {
  Run(one string, i int) error
}

func NewRunner(something bar.Something) Runner {
  return newRunner(something)
}

// runner.go
package foo

type runner struct{
  something bar.Something
}

func newRunner(something bar.Something) *runner {
  return &runner{something}
}

func (r *runner) Run(one string, i int) error {
  r.hello(i)
  return r.something.Bar(one, i+1)
}

func (r *runner) hello(i int) {
  return r.something.Hello(i)
}
```
              
* Most structs that have functions attached have a separate file with the private struct definition, private constructor, and public functions, then private functions. The runner struct above is an example.

* Use struct pointers in general instead of structs. It's a debate, but not for now.

* Function parameters/struct initialization/function calls etc are either on one line or each parameter/field has a new line for it. Example:

```go
// yes
function oneLine(a string, b string, c string) {
}

//yes
function multiLine(
  a string,
  b string,
  c string,
) {
}

//no
function multiLineNo(
  a string,
  b string,
  c string) {
}

// no
function multiLineNo2(a string,
  b string, c string) {
}
```

* **NO CALLING `os.Exit(...)` OR `panic(...)` IN LIBRARY CODE.** Ie nowhere but a main package.

* New introductions of global variables and init functions have to be vetted extensively by project owners (and existing ones should be deleted as much as we can).

* No reliance on freeform string matching for errors.

* No typing dynamic value primitives. Example:

```go
// no
type VolumeID string

type Volume struct {
  VolumeID VolumeID
  ...
}

//yes
type Volume struct {
  VolumeID string  
}
```

* Static value primitives (also known as enums) are not strings. Most new ones should be generated with protobuf, see [api/api.proto](api/api.proto) for examples.

* Remove most uses of private variables in public structs.

* Remove most extra variable definitions that are not needed or turn into constants (https://github.com/libopenstorage/openstorage/blob/8d07329468ef709838e443dc17b1eecf2c7cf77d/api/server/volume.go#L76).

* Reduce adding of String() methods on most objects (let the generic `%+v` take care of it).

* Use less newlines within methods.

* Single errors are scoped within an if statement:

```go
// no
err := foo()
if err != nil {
  return nil, err
}

// yes
if err := foo(); err != nil {
  return nil, err
}

// yes, if ignoring return value
// if _, err := bar(); err != nil {
  return nil, err
}
```
    
* Empty structs:

```go
// no
type EmptyStruct {
}
// yes
type EmptyStruct {}
```

* Blank imports should have explanation (https://github.com/libopenstorage/openstorage/blob/8d07329468ef709838e443dc17b1eecf2c7cf77d/volume/enumerator.go#L6).

* No code checked in that has warnings https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/.

* Do not check in if `make docker-test` does not pass.
